## Advantages and disadvantages of JavaScript libraries/frameworks
This document will give you insight about javascript frameworks.  
What are the pros and cons?

## The advantages of using JS Frameworks.
Frameworks give a stable code structure andhas a robust list of featers.  
Half of te work is already done, for example:  
* Cross-browser compability
* Security flaws
* Core functions
* And more stuff, depends on the framework.

With all of that said, It is helpfull to add a framework to your project if it fits the needs!

### Learning curve
Are frameworks hard to learn? Well.. it depends on the community.
Does the framework you want to use also got a well-established community as well as support documentation?
If the awnser is yes, you'll probably have a **good** time.
If not, you might want to reconsider the choice of the framework.

## The Disadvantages of JS Frameworks
Before you dive deep into the abyss of framworks. 
You really need to reconsider if you **need** a framework!  
Person 1: "Uhh with all that awesome stuff you told me earlier why should I not use a framework?"  
Person 2: Sudo rm  Person 1.

Think about it. With all that powerfull stuff, your projects might not be as lightweighted as it _should_ be.

### Vanilla JS
Vanilla JS compared to frameworks will run quicker, because of the bloatware(veel overbodige functionaliteit).
Frameworks comapred to Vanilla JS also got his own way to do functionality.
Writing code in Vanilla JS also makes you Independant of he updates and actions of the framework.

## My Opinion
Look good at the project, write down the global functionality of the project.  
If your project implements complex functionality that is already written in a Framework.
You'll might reconsider to use a framework to make the project easier and faster.
